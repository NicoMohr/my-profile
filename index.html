				<p>
					Hello ! I'm glad to see you on my profile. I'm a 1st year student at ESSEC Business School and this is my first HTML/CSS project. As you'll notice I'm a huge fan of soccer and I'm a true supporter of the soccer team of my town. Here is a link to their website.

				<h2>My childhood üßí</h2>
				<p>
				Even though I moved a lot during my childhood, I have always been sticking around East of France. From Mulhouse to Strasbourg, I have been able to discover in details almost every area in the region and I had the opportunity to meet wonderful and warmful people who made my childhood brighter.

				<h2>Sports üèÖ</h2>
				<p>
				Sports has always been close and familiar to me. I experienced numerous sports: soccer, tennis, table tennis, volleyball, running and even swimming. This wide range of sports truly helped me shaping my behaviour and my way of life. I used to practice sports in competition but today I'm much more focused on having fun rather than on winning at all costs.

				<h2>Astronomy üî≠</h2>
				<p>
				Astronomy is a quite uncommon leisure for teenagers or students. But for me it is definitely different. This topic started to really interest me when I was around 14 years old. And what is funny is that this passion began by chance when I just stumbled upon a NASA video when I was killing time on YouTube. This short video truly fascinated me and made me want to know more about the topic.
